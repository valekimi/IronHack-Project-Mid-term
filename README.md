Reflections and things i found important or hard to achieve:

----DAY 1----

HOME PAGE

- understand structure and element of the page to start the files and the code structures.
- setting styles from the beginning helps in working faster, also is it possible to the assign styles directly in html (ex. text and button styles)
- display flex is basically applied in every section
- floating images are tough to manage, still need to understand what is the best rule.
- if you dont set a background color for a button, it will be given a gray by default
- text always come with a own margin or padding, not always visible from inspect, how to avoid this?!
- in inspect, showing layouts helps visually to adjust elements
- I am still fighting with the width of the sections, maybe i set width incorrectly
- most important, I finished the home page, even if it is not perfect!


----DAY 2----

CONTACT PAGE

- the inputs have a placeholder text that by default is or "monospace" or another one, so I had to apply again the font family in the CSS tag
- Input type can be declared also in CSS directly in this format: ex .email input[type="email"] 


PROJECT 1 PAGE

- To do a blur effect of the main image, it is necessary to create 2 divs containing the same image, one will be position relative and the other absolute, with filter: blur and also opacity if needed. Also, div with the effect needs to be placed in the HTML before than the main image, otherwise the effect will be applied on top. 
- fetch API.... help!
- ok i manage to fetch the first part, here i discovered that you can already give sizes to the image and remove it from css. This steps given me headache as i couldn't understand why the image was not adapting to the size i pre-set in css.
- i am having some issue in adapting the blur background to the size i need as seems not working in the same way of the main image

GENERAL

- I just realized that the Project page is the Project one, so should not be connected with the project page of the menu
- I also realized that all the pages are not respecting my max width given but they are applying some size took from (?) still need to figure out
