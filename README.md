HOME PAGE

Reflections and things i found important or hard to achieve:
- understand structure and element of the page to start the files and the code structures.
- setting styles from the beginning helps in working faster, also is it possible to the assign styles directly in html (ex. text and button styles)
- display flex is basically applied in every section
- floating images are tough to manage, still need to understand what is the best rule.
- if you dont set a background color for a button, it will be given a gray by default
- text always come with a own margin or padding, not always visible from inspect, how to avoid this?!
- in inspect, showing layouts helps visually to adjust elements
- I am still fighting with the width of the sections, maybe i set width incorrectly
- most important, I finished the home page, even if it is not perfect!
